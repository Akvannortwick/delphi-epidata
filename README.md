# About

This is the home of [Delphi](https://delphi.cmu.edu/)'s epidemiological data
API. See our [API documentation](docs/api/README.md) for details on the available data sets, APIs, and clients.


# COVID-19 Notice

**Note:** this repository was built to support modeling and forecasting efforts
surrounding seasonal influenza (and dengue).  In the current COVID-19 pandemic,
syndromic surveillance data, like ILI data (influenza-like illness) through
FluView, will likely prove very useful.  However, **we urge caution to users
examining the digital surveillance sensors**, like ILI Nearby, Google Flu
Trends, etc., during the COVID-19 pandemic, because these were designed to track
ILI as driven by seasonal influenza, and were NOT designed to track ILI during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are working on collecting new ILI-related data sources may be useful to
nowcasting and forecasting ILI during the COVID-19 pandemic, and will make these
available as soon as possible.

For a list of many data sources relevant to COVID-19 (case data, hospitalization
data, data on interventions, etc.) we have compiled a simple
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Nn_3ZvSLnpxRyA2DkoMMzyrd11-AlGJXasS0owln88/edit#gid=0)
with links to various external sites.
