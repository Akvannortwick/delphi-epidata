# Epidata API

This is the GitHub Pages home for the Epidata API.

The Epidata API is built and maintained by the Carnegie Mellon University
[Delphi research group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/). Explore one way in which
Delphi is responding to the pandemic by visiting the
[covidcast endpoint](api/covidcast). 

The Delphi group is extremely grateful for Pedrito Maynard-Zhang for all his
help with the Epidata API [documentation](api).
