# Epidata API

This is the GitHub Pages home for the Epidata API.

For now, the API is documented in the repo's top-level
[`README.md`](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/delphi-epidata/blob/master/README.md).

The Epidata API is built and maintained by the Carnegie Mellon University
[Delphi research group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/). Explore one way in which
