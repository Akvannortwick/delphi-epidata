# Delphi's COVID-19 Surveillance Streams Data

Delphi's COVID-19 Surveillance Streams data includes the following data sources.
Data from these sources is expected to be updated daily. You can use the
[`covidcast_meta`](covidcast_meta.md) API endpoint to get summary information
about the ranges of the different attributes for the different data sources.

The API for retrieving data from these sources is described in the
[COVIDcast API endpoint documentation](covidcast.md).

## Sources and Signals

### `doctor-visits`

Data source based on outpatient visits, provided to us by healthcare
partners. Using this outpatient data, we estimate the percentage of
COVID-related doctor's visits in a given location, on a given day.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `smoothed_cli` | Estimated percentage of outpatient doctor visits primarily about COVID-related symptoms, based on data from healthcare partners, smoothed in time using a Gaussian linear smoother |
| `smoothed_adj_cli` | Same, but with systematic day-of-week effects removed (so that every day "looks like" a Monday)| 

Day-of-week effects are removed by fitting a model to all data in the United
States; the model includes a fixed effect for each day of the week, except
Monday. Once these effects are estimated, they are subtracted from each
geographic area's time series. This removes day-to-day variation that arises
solely from clinic schedules, work schedules, and other variation in doctor's
visits that arise solely because of the day of week.

Note that because doctor's visits may be reported to our healthcare partners
several days after they occur, these signals are typically available with
several days of lag. This means that estimates for a specific day are only
available several days later.

### `fb-survey`

Data source based on symptom surveys run by Carnegie Mellon. Facebook directs a 
random sample of its users to these surveys, which are voluntary. Individual
survey responses are held by CMU and are shareable with other health researchers
under a data use agreement. No individual survey responses are shared back to
Facebook. Of primary interest in these surveys are the symptoms defining a
COVID-like illness (fever, along with cough, or shortness of breath, or
difficulty breathing) or influenza-like illness (fever, along with cough or sore
throat).  Using this survey data, we estimate the percentage of people who have
a COVID-like illness, or influenza-like illness, in a given location, on a given
day.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `raw_cli` | Estimated percentage of people with COVID-like illness, with no smoothing or survey weighting |
| `raw_ili` | Estimated percentage of people with influenza-like illness, with no smoothing or survey weighting |
| `raw_wcli` | Estimated percentage of people with COVID-like illness; adjusted using survey weights |
| `raw_wili` | Estimated percentage of people with influenza-like illness; adjusted using survey weights |
| `raw_hh_cmnty_cli` | Estimated percentage of people reporting COVID-like illness in their local community, including their household, with no smoothing or survey weighting |
| `raw_nohh_cmnty_cli` | Estimated percentage of people reporting COVID-like illness in their local community, not including their household, with no smoothing or survey weighting |

The survey weights, provided by Facebook, are intended to make the sample
representative of the US population, according to the state, age, and gender of
the US population from the 2018 Census March Supplement.

Along with the `raw_` signals, there are additional signals with names beginning
with `smoothed_`. These estimate the same quantities as the above signals, but
are smoothed in time to reduce day-to-day sampling noise; importantly (due to
the way in which our smoothing works, which is based on pooling data across 
successive days), these smoothed signals are generally available at many more
counties (and MSAs) than the raw signals. 

### `google-survey`

Data source based on Google-run symptom surveys, through publisher websites,
their Opinions Reward app, and similar applications. Respondents can opt to skip
the survey and complete a different one if they prefer not to answer. The survey
is just one question long, and asks "Do you know someone in your community who
is sick (fever, along with cough, or shortness of breath, or difficulty
breathing) right now?" Using this survey data, we estimate the percentage of
people in a given location, on a given day, that *know somebody who has a 
COVID-like illness*. Note that this is tracking a different quantity than the
surveys through Facebook, and (unsurprisingly) the estimates here tend to be
much larger.

The survey sampled from all counties with greater than 100,000 population, along
with a separate random sample from each state. This means that the megacounties
(discussed in the [COVIDcast API documentation](covidcast.md)) are always the
counties with populations smaller than 100,000, and megacounty estimates are
created by combining the state-level survey with the observed county surveys.

These surveys were run daily until May 15, 2020. After that date, new national
data will not be collected regularly, although the surveys may be deployed in
specific geographical areas as needed to support forecasting efforts.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `raw_cli` | Estimated percentage of people who know someone in their community with COVID-like illness |
| `smoothed_cli` | Estimated percentage of people who know someone in their community with COVID-like illness, smoothed in time |

### `ght`

Data source based on Google searches, provided to us by Google Health 
Trends.  Using this search data, we estimate the volume of COVID-related
searches in a given location, on a given day.  This signal is measured in
arbitrary units (its scale is meaningless); larger numbers represent higher
numbers of COVID-related searches. Note that this source is not available for
individual counties, as it is reported only for larger geographical areas, and
so county estimates are not available from the API.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `raw_search` | Google search volume for COVID-related searches, in arbitrary units that are normalized for population | 
| `smoothed_search` | Google search volume for COVID-related searches, in arbitrary units that are normalized for population, smoothed in time using a local linear smoother with Gaussian kernel | 

### `quidel`

Data source based on flu lab tests, provided to us by Quidel, Inc. When a
patient (whether at a doctorâ€™s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like
symptoms, doctors may perform a flu test to rule out seasonal flu (influenza),
because these two diseases have similar symptoms. Using this lab test data, we
estimate the total number of flu tests per medical device (a measure of testing
frequency), and the percentage of flu tests that are *negative* (since ruling
out flu leaves open another cause---possibly covid---for the patient's
symptoms), in a given location, on a given day.

The number of flu tests conducted in individual counties can be quite small, so
we do not report these signals at the county level.

The flu test data is no longer updated as of May 19, 2020, as the number of flu
tests conducted during the summer (outside of the normal flu season) is quite
small. The data may be updated again when the Winter 2020 flu season begins.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `raw_pct_negative` | The percentage of flu tests that are negative, suggesting the patient's illness has another cause, possibly COVID-19 |
| `smoothed_pct_negative` | Same as above, but smoothed in time |
| `raw_tests_per_device` | The number of flu tests conducted by each testing device; measures volume of testing | 
| `smoothed_tests_per_device` | Same as above, but smoothed in time |

### `jhu-csse`

Data source of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, based on reports made
available by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins
University.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed_cumulative_num` | Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases |
| `confirmed_cumulative_prop` | Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population |
| `confirmed_incidence_num` | Number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, daily | 
| `confirmed_incidence_prop` | Number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, daily | 
| `deaths_cumulative_num` | Cumulative number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 |
| `deaths_cumulative_prop` | Cumulative number of confirmed due to COVID-19, per 100,000 population |
| `deaths_incidence_num` | Number of new confirmed deaths due to COVID-19, daily |
| `deaths_incidence_prop` | Number of new confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population, daily |

Our signals here are taken directly from the JHU CSSE 
[COVID-19 GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) without 
filtering, smoothing, or changes.

### `indicator-combination`

This source provides signals which are statistical combinations of the other
sources above. It is not a primary data source.

* `nmf_day_doc_fbc_fbs_ght`: This signal uses a rank-1 approximation, from a
  nonnegative matrix factorization approach, to identify an underlying signal
  that best reconstructs the Doctor Visits (`smoothed_adj_cli`), Facebook
  Symptoms surveys (`smoothed_cli`), Facebook Symptoms in Community surveys
  (`smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli`), and Search Trends (`smoothed_search`) indicators.
  It does not include official reports (cases and deaths from the `jhu-csse`
  source). Higher values of the combined signal correspond to higher values of
  the other indicators, but the scale (units) of the combination is arbitrary.
  Note that the Search Trends source is not available at the county level, so
  county values of this signal do not use it.
* `nmf_day_doc_fbs_ght`: This signal is calculated in the same way as
  `nmf_day_doc_fbc_fbs_ght`, but does *not* include the Symptoms in Community
  survey signal, which was not available at the time this signal was introduced.
  It also uses `smoothed_cli` from the `doctor-visits` source instead of
  `smoothed_adj_cli`. This signal is deprecated and is no longer updated as of
  May 28, 2020.
