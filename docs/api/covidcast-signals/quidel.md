* **Date of last change:** Never

Data source based on flu lab tests, provided to us by Quidel, Inc. When a
patient (whether at a doctorâ€™s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like
symptoms, doctors may perform a flu test to rule out seasonal flu (influenza),
because these two diseases have similar symptoms. Using this lab test data, we
estimate the total number of flu tests per medical device (a measure of testing
frequency), and the percentage of flu tests that are *negative* (since ruling
out flu leaves open another cause---possibly covid---for the patient's
symptoms), in a given location, on a given day.

The number of flu tests conducted in individual counties can be quite small, so
we do not report these signals at the county level.

The flu test data is no longer updated as of May 19, 2020, as the number of flu
tests conducted during the summer (outside of the normal flu season) is quite
small. The data may be updated again when the Winter 2020 flu season begins.

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `raw_pct_negative` | The percentage of flu tests that are negative, suggesting the patient's illness has another cause, possibly COVID-19 |
| `smoothed_pct_negative` | Same as above, but smoothed in time |
| `raw_tests_per_device` | The number of flu tests conducted by each testing device; measures volume of testing |
| `smoothed_tests_per_device` | Same as above, but smoothed in time |
