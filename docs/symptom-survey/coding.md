# Coding

All choice responses are recorded numerically starting from 1, in displayed
order from left to right and top to bottom. When the respondent is allowed to
select multiple responses, these are shown separated by commas, such as `2,4,6`.

An additional coding file for question A3b, "In which state are you currently
staying?" is provided here as A3b-coding.txt.
