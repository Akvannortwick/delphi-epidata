# COVID Symptom Survey

Delphi conducts a voluntary COVID-19 symptom survey, distributed daily via a
partnership with Facebook. This survey asks respondents about COVID-like
symptoms, their behavior (such as social distancing), mental health, and
economic and health impacts they have experienced as a result of the pandemic.

Aggregate data from this survey is available through the [COVIDcast
API](../api/covidcast.md) as the [`fb-survey` data
source](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).

This documentation is for users who have a signed Data Use Agreement to receive
individual response data from the survey. It describes the survey items, data
coding, data distribution, and the survey weights computed by Facebook.
